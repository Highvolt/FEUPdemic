# FEUPdemic

## Premise
A strategy/simulation game where the player controls a disease. The player must infect and kill all the humans at FEUP by evolving the disease and adapting to the environment before the humans can develop a cure for it.

## Player motivation
The victory condition is infecting and killing all humans. For each human infected or killed, points are earned and can be spent in disease upgrades. All this must be done while the humans are working against the disease, trying to achieve a cure for it, once they notice the disease existence..
